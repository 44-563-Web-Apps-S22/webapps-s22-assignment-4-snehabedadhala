    <p class="speech">Because seeing your bosom causes me grief.
        Through one's eyes one's soul may be wounded,
        And then sinful thoughts may grow unattended.</p>
    <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Then you are quite ready for temptation,
        And bare skin makes on you a big impression.
        I truly don't know why you feel such passion;
        I myself think lust is out of fashion,
        For I could see you nude from top to toe
        Without your pelt setting my cheeks aglow.</p>
    <h6 class="name Tartuffe">Tartuffe.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Put a little modesty in your discourse
        Or I must leave you instantly perforce.</p>
    <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">No, it is I who will leave you here in peace,
        And I will just say this before I cease:
        Madam is coming down to visit you
        And demands the favor of a rendezvous.</p>
    <h6 class="name Tartuffe">Tartuffe.</h6>  
    <p class="speech">Oh yes!  Most willingly!</p>
    <h6 class="name Dorine">Dorine</h6> 
    <p class="direction">[to herself].</p>
    <p class="speech">                Isn't he sweet!
        I'm even surer now that dog's in heat.</p>
